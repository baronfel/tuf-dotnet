# TUF .NET Conformance Test Expected Failures
#
# This file lists test cases that are expected to fail while the .NET TUF implementation
# is being developed to achieve full conformance. As features are implemented, tests
# should be removed from this list.
#
# Format: One test identifier per line, comments starting with #
#
# Common categories of expected failures during development:
#
# Key algorithm support - if specific key types aren't implemented yet:
# test_*[ed25519]
# test_*[ecdsa]
# test_*[rsa-pss]
#
# Hash algorithm support - if specific hash algorithms aren't implemented yet:
# test_*[sha512]
# test_*[blake2b]
#
# Advanced TUF features - if not yet implemented:
# test_delegations_*
# test_multisig_*
# test_consistent_snapshot_*
#
# Network/HTTP specific behavior:
# test_max_request_*
# test_timeout_*
#
# For now, we'll start with no expected failures and see what the test suite reveals
# about the current implementation state. This file can be updated based on actual
# test results.
